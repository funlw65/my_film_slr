# :boom: My film SLR camera 

A homemade film SLR camera, that can use manual and Canon EOS Lenses. If is a classic SLR, the shutter can be mechanical (horizontal cloth or vertical metal) or electromechanical (in which case, it is borrowed from a SLR or DSLR defective camera). 

It will follow a classic '70 SLR, where the shutter speeds and aperture are in full stops - remember, we use film.
